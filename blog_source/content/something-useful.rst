OK, maybe my last post was a little childish. You can hardly fault me for taking
advantage of a situation like that when it was staring me in the face, though.

To make up for a little of that, I figure that I can be a *little* more useful
than getting **both** the boss and the PFY electricuted in the same day }:-D

The source for this blog and the tools which can be used to deploy it are
available at::

  http://localhost/somewhere

It should be pretty straight-forward and there are readme files for each of the
deployment methods.

Enjoy ... and ask questions at your own risk. You wouldn't want anything to
happen to your disk quota or your embarassing emails to be aired, would you?
